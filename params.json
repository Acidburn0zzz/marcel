{"name":"Marcel","tagline":"Le docker français","body":"# Marcel, the french Docker - Marcel, le docker français\r\n\r\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brouberol/marcel/master/logo.png)\r\n\r\nMarcel is a french wrapper around the docker CLI, intended as a drop-in replacement of docker, for the future french sovereign operating system.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n* ``docker run`` → ``marcel chauffe``\r\n* ``docker images`` → ``marcel cederoms``\r\n* ``docker login`` → ``marcel vos-papiers``\r\n* ``docker logs`` → ``marcel bûches``\r\n* ``docker pause`` → ``marcel rtt``\r\n* ``docker suspend`` → ``marcel grève``\r\n* ``docker tag`` → ``marcel graffiti``\r\n* ``docker rmi`` → ``marcel rsa``\r\n\r\n## Dockerfile\r\n\r\nObviously, the ``Dockerfile`` name is not sovereign enough for us. That's why instead of ``Dockerfile``s, marcel uses ``RecetteÀMarcel`` files.\r\nFor now, they use the exact same syntax as ``Dockerfile``, but we'll see about that.\r\n\r\nFor it to work, you just need to include a ``RecetteÀMarcel`` file in the current directory where you execute your ``marcel construis`` command, are you're good to go.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nThe [original idea](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/19396) came of [@ndeloof](https://github.com/ndeloof)'s mind.\r\nThe logo was provided by [jkneb](https://github.com/jkneb).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
